# Order Management REST API ![CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/albanoj2/order-rest-backend.svg?branch=master)

Demonstrates a simple RESTful web service using Spring MVC and Java. This web service provides an in-memory order management service, with the capability to get a single order, get all orders, create an order, delete an order, and update an order. After exploring this project, the reader will understand the three common layers of a RESTful web service (namely domain, data source, and presentation), the common design decisions used when creating a web service, and the functionality provided by the Spring framework for creating a web service (as well as supplemental functionality, such as creating [HATEOAS](http://projects.spring.io/spring-hateoas/) links). In particular, the reader will learn

 - How to create a domain model
 - How to store domain objects in a persistence layer
 - How to wrap domain objects within resource objects
 - How to add HATEOAS links to a resource
 - How to serve up resources to a client over HTTP
 - How to provide RESTful Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations to change domain objects
 - How to create unit, integration, and acceptance tests that exercise a REST API

## Starting the Order Management System
To start this web service, install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and execute the following command

    mvn spring-boot:run
    
Once the web service is started, it can be reached at

    http://localhost:8080/order

## REST Endpoints
The following REST endpoints are available upon deployment of the order management system:

| HTTP Verb        | URL           | Description  | Status Codes |
| ------------- |-------------|:-----| ----|
| `GET` | `http://localhost:8080/order` | Obtains a list of all existing orders | <ul><li>`200 OK`</li></ul> |
| `GET` | `http://localhost:8080/order/{id}` | Obtains the order corresponding to the supplied order ID | <ul><li>`200 OK` if order exists</li><li>`404 Not Found` if order does not exist</li></ul> |
| `POST` | `http://localhost:8080/order` | Creates a new order based on the payload contained in the request body | <ul><li>`201 Created` if order successfully created</li></ul> |
| `PUT` | `http://localhost:8080/order/{id}` | Updated an existing order with the data contained in the request body | <ul><li>`200 OK` if order succesfully updated</li><li>`404 Not Found` if order does not exist</li></ul> |
| `DELETE` | `http://localhost:8080/order/{id}` | Deletes an existing order that corresponds to the supplied order ID | <ul><li>`204 No Content` if order succesfully deleted</li><li>`404 Not Found` if order does not exist</li></ul> |
